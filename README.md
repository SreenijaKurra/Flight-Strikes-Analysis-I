# Flight-Strikes-Analysis - I

Based on an inconsiderate attempt to understand the loss in the airplane industry, I designed this project on Tableau. 

Data Processing was done in Excel and imported to Tableau for some sleek and powerful dashboard presets.

Various birds keep getting in the flight path and ruin flying experience for the pilots and cause collateral damage to airline companies. 
Cleaning up the carcass also inretupts with airline operations at the ATC level. All this is super annoying if you know that its caused by something thats a metre width and 10 cms height. 

If we disect the statistics of impact just like how the wildlife gets squashed after getting in the way, we get to analyse the top affected airports, average cost of damage by each specie, number of strikes over time, and type of flight damage. 


<h2>What's the takeaway?</h2>
As an analyst, it is great to see datasets that branch large under multiple categories. One of such is this dataset, niche but vast.
Due to the country commercializing everything, which is great for analysts like me, we have data exclusively to get the damage analysis. Flying has become a common form of transportation now. We cannot really work on reducing the carbon footprint when vacation is everything that's on our mind for long weekends. But poor birds do it for survival in the winters. We've noticed least number of strikes in the months of January and February due to winter migration. And increased strikes in July and August. This is because, once the birds are back, they bring new life into the world and train them how to fly. But knowing when to fly cannot be really taught to younglings. 

The young brids use their newly learnt flying skills to soar near empty spaces, such as the airport runways. This can be prevented by the airport authorities. They can make sure the environment around the airports is not habitable by birds while maintaining green space. This is a difficult option and hard to implement considering various habitat situations.  

The type of flight damage indirectly shows us the $$ impact on flights. For instance, with one flight down due to engine failure, it leads to grounding of that flight for repair. Meanwhile, other flights are being rescheduled, prices increase due to less availability and forming a chain reaction: PRICE HIKES. While most of the strikes are non deadly, this environmental harm can take down many lives with the increase in air traffic.

The display is quite off as I tried embedding Tableau dashboard in this repo, you will not find anything but the poorly presented, smartly designed dashboard. I will copy paste this exact words if I face the same issue with Flight Strike Analysis - II repo.
